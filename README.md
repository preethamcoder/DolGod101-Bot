This bot currently only plays music. However, I have plans to add new functionalities to it, including administrative roles and meme generators.
It has been hosted on a Docker container now, and it plays music. It seems to have problems while extracting multiple videos in a playlist. That needs to be fixed.
I aim to add a "roast" command and a "meme" command soon enough.
