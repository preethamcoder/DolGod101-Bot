This bot currently plays music, roasts users in regular and Shakespearean English, sends out random memes, and shares spiritual knowledge when prompted. Now, I aim to improve the current features by adding an NLP-based recognition for certain meming situations. The bot is currenly running on a Docker container, and will soon be able to join servers.
One prominent issue is the inability of the bot to play music on different servers simultaneously, in addition to being unable to play certain YouTube playlists.
